### Team-Specific Policies

The following policies are specific to the **[305Soft]** team and are mandatory for all members.

#### Technology Use During Meetings

The **305Soft policy is strictly no distracted use of technology** (e.g., phones away, laptops used only for meeting-related content) during all team meetings. Our full attention is required to ensure productive and efficient collaboration.

#### Decision Making

Decisions will primarily be made by **consensus** (general agreement). If a consensus cannot be reached after a reasonable discussion, decisions will then be made by a **majority vote** of all members.

#### Attendance

1.  **Expectations:** All team members are expected to attend **all scheduled meetings** (e.g., bi-weekly standups, weekly planning sessions). Attendance is expected to be *in-person* unless the team has designated a virtual medium (e.g., Zoom).
2.  **Legitimate Reasons for Missing:** Legitimate reasons for missing a meeting include illness, family emergency, or required academic/professional conflicts communicated **at least 24 hours in advance** where possible.
3.  **Making Up for Missed Meetings:** A missing member is required to **read the meeting minutes/notes, review all assigned tasks, and proactively follow up** with the note-taker or team lead *before the next meeting* to ensure they are fully caught up and any individual deadlines are addressed.

#### Assignments

1.  **Assignment Allocation:** Assignments will be made based on a combination of **member strengths, expressed interests, and equitable distribution** of workload. We will use a team planning tool (e.g., Trello/GitHub Projects) to track and assign tasks.
2.  **Dealing with Incomplete/Poorly Completed Assignments:** If a member fails to complete (or poorly completes) an assignment:
    * **First Instance:** A private, direct conversation will be held between the member and the team lead/designated mentor to understand the issue and identify support needs. A plan for completion will be created.
    * **Repeated Instances:** The team will hold a private discussion to determine if re-allocation of work or additional accountability measures are needed, up to and including formal disciplinary action if the issue persists and impacts project delivery.

#### Participation & Communication

1.  **Information Sharing:** We will primarily communicate via **[Specify Medium, e.g., Slack/Discord]** for quick updates and use **[Specify Medium, e.g., GitHub/Google Drive]** for sharing and documenting core project files and documentation.
2.  **Ensuring Full Participation:** The team will use **"round-robin" or "check-in" structures** at key points in a discussion to ensure every voice is heard. Team members are encouraged to **proactively invite quiet members** to share their thoughts.
3.  **Honoring Strengths and Interests:** We will conduct an initial **skills and interest inventory** and revisit it regularly. Assignments and roles will be matched to these strengths where feasible to maximize individual contribution and job satisfaction.

#### Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums

Initial meeting times and locations/mediums (e.g., Room 205 / Zoom link) were decided to suit all current members. Any proposed change to the standing time or location must be agreed upon by **unanimous consent** of the team to ensure no member is involuntarily excluded.

#### Agenda and Minutes / Notes

1.  **Agenda:** The team lead will draft and share an agenda **at least 3 hours prior** to a meeting.
2.  **Minutes/Notes:** The role of **Note Taker** will **rotate weekly** among all team members (excluding the team lead unless necessary). Minutes will include decisions, assigned tasks, and key discussion points, and will be shared via **[Specify Medium, e.g., shared drive folder/Slack channel]** within **3 hours** of the meeting end.

#### Promptness

1.  **Expectation:** All members are expected to be **on time** for all meetings and deadlines. Being "on time" means ready to start at the designated minute.
2.  **Handling Lateness:** A member who is late is expected to enter quietly and not disrupt the discussion. If a member is **repeatedly late** without a valid reason, the team lead will hold a private check-in to resolve the underlying issue.

#### Conversational Courtesies

1.  **Active Listening:** We will encourage active listening by **paraphrasing** to confirm understanding before responding.
2.  **Sharing the Airtime:** We will use the **"three-before-me"** rule, where if one person has spoken three times, they should actively pause and encourage others to speak before offering a fourth comment. We will be mindful of interrupting and only interject if the safety or progress of the team is immediately at risk.
3.  **Tangents:** If a tangent arises, one member will politely but firmly say, **"Parking Lot"** to note the idea for a separate discussion, and refocus the group on the agenda item.
4.  **Respectful Dialogue:** We commit to always **critiquing ideas, not people**. Debates will focus on project outcomes and technical merit.

### Enforcement / Feedback

#### Enforcement of Rules

The team will enforce its own rules through a tiered approach:
1.  **Peer-to-Peer:** The first level is gentle, private reminders between team members.
2.  **Team Check-in:** For recurring issues, the team will dedicate 5-10 minutes at the start or end of a meeting to a respectful, non-judgmental discussion about how the team can collectively better follow the Code of Conduct.
3.  **Team Lead/Mentor Intervention:** For persistent issues or severe breaches, the issue will be escalated to the team lead or faculty mentor.

#### Giving and Receiving Feedback

1.  **Giving Feedback:** Individuals prefer to give feedback **in a private, direct conversation** using the **"Start-Stop-Continue"** framework (i.e., "Start doing X," "Stop doing Y," "Continue doing Z").
2.  **Receiving Feedback:** Individuals prefer to receive feedback **in a private, direct conversation**, followed up with a written summary (e.g., an email) for clarity. We commit to the principle that when receiving feedback, we will first **listen to understand** before offering a defense.
